- bind execute command vs. insert
- not clear which files are loaded
    x should ignores symlinks but otherwise get all osh files
    - should only ignore symlinks that point to files we are going to load anyway
- look at binary formats or use my own
    - https://capnproto.org/
    - https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust?tab=readme-ov-file
- understand Rust pdqsort in detail and write better benchs
    - also look into glidesort: https://github.com/orlp/glidesort
- use bind to switch between filtered and unfiltered
    - probably need a reload command (output to stdout) and bind that: `"tab:reload(osh-oxy reload --all)"`
- splitting lib up in different formats (when adding more)
x add profiling info for various parts to figure out which improvements might speed up startup time
    x sorting
    x loading file
    x ...
c support different ways of merging/sorting history search
x robust output parsing
x no value when ctrl-c
x fix search args (session-id/time filter)
x use rust native fzf library?
