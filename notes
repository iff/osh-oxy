- add profiling info for various parts to figure out which improvements might speed up startup time
    - sorting
    - loading file
    - ...
- use bind to switch between filtered and unfiltered
    - probably need a reload command (output to stdout) and bind that: `"tab:reload(osh-oxy reload --all)"`
- splitting lib up in different formats (when adding more)
c support different ways of merging/sorting history search
x robust output parsing
x no value when ctrl-c
x fix search args (session-id/time filter)
x use rust native fzf library?
